# Unity Game Development Tasks

This folder contains specialized workflows for the Unity expansion pack. All tasks are intended to be resolved via the IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION rules.

- `game-design-brainstorming.md` - mirrors the Phaser brainstorming guide with Unity-specific notes; update both packs together when making changes.
- Other tasks in this folder provide the Unity-focused elicitation, story creation, validation, and course-correction workflows.

Keep this directory complete so agent references in `agents/game-designer.md` always resolve successfully.
