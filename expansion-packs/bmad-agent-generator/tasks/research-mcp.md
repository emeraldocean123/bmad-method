# Research MCP Servers Task

## Objective

Discover and integrate relevant MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that can enhance the specialized BMAD agent with real-time capabilities and tool access.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) provides a standardized way for AI assistants to interact with external systems through:

- **Resources**: Files, data, and content the assistant can access
- **Tools**: Functions the assistant can execute
- **Prompts**: Reusable prompt templates

### 2. Analyze Project for MCP Needs

Based on project analysis, identify which MCP servers would be most valuable:

```yaml
mcp_requirements:
  essential:
    - name: [MCP server name]
      purpose: [Why it's needed]
      capabilities: [What it provides]
  nice_to_have:
    - name: [MCP server name]
      purpose: [Enhancement it offers]
  research_needed:
    - technology: [Tech without known MCP]
      potential_benefit: [What MCP would add]
```

### 3. MCP Integration Research

For each relevant MCP server found:

#### Examine Capabilities

```
1. Clone/examine the MCP server repository
2. Review the README for:
   - Available tools/functions
   - Resource access patterns
   - Configuration requirements
   - Authentication needs
3. Check server.py/index.js for actual implementations
4. Look for example usage patterns
```

#### Document Integration Points

```yaml
mcp_server:
  name: [Server name]
  repository: [GitHub URL]
  capabilities:
    tools:
      - name: [Tool name]
        description: [What it does]
        use_case: [When agent would use it]
    resources:
      - type: [Resource type]
        access: [What it provides access to]
    prompts:
      - name: [Prompt template]
        purpose: [What it's for]
  integration:
    installation: [How to install]
    configuration: [Required config]
    authentication: [Auth requirements]
  agent_benefits:
    - [Specific benefit 1]
    - [Specific benefit 2]
```

### 4. Custom MCP Server Opportunities

Identify gaps where custom MCP servers could be created:

```yaml
custom_mcp_opportunities:
  - need: [Unmet need]
    description: [What custom MCP would do]
    complexity: [Easy/Medium/Hard]
    value: [High/Medium/Low]
  - need: [Another gap]
    existing_alternative: [Workaround if any]
    improvement: [How MCP would be better]
```

### 5. MCP Integration Strategy

Design how the agent will use MCP servers:

#### Direct Integration

```markdown
## MCP Integration

This agent integrates with the following MCP servers:

### Required MCP Servers

1. **[mcp-name]** - [Purpose]
   - Installation: `npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/[name]`
   - Provides: [Capabilities]
   - Used for: [Specific agent commands]

### Optional MCP Servers

1. **[mcp-name]** - [Enhancement]
   - Adds: [Additional capabilities]
   - Benefits: [What it improves]
```

#### Agent Commands Using MCP

```yaml
commands:
  validate-package: # Example for mcp-nixos
    description: 'Validate NixOS package availability'
    mcp_server: mcp-nixos
    mcp_tool: search_packages

  commit-changes: # Example for mcp-git
    description: 'Commit code changes'
    mcp_server: mcp-git
    mcp_tool: git_commit

  query-database: # Example for mcp-postgres
    description: 'Query project database'
    mcp_server: mcp-postgres
    mcp_tool: execute_query
```
