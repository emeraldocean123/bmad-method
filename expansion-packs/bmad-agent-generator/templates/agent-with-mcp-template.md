# Agent Template with MCP Integration

This template shows how a generated agent looks with MCP server integration.

## Example: React Development Agent with MCP

````markdown
# react-dev-expert

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This file contains your full agent operating guidelines with MCP integration support.

## MCP INTEGRATION

This agent integrates with the following MCP servers for enhanced capabilities:

### Required MCP Servers

- **mcp-typescript**: Real-time TypeScript validation, type checking, and refactoring tools
- **mcp-git**: Git operations for version control and collaboration
- **mcp-github**: GitHub API integration for PR management and issue tracking

### Optional MCP Servers

- **mcp-postgres**: If your React app uses PostgreSQL backend
- **mcp-docker**: For containerized development environments
- **mcp-aws**: For deployment to AWS services

### Installation

\```bash

# Install required MCP servers

npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/mcp-typescript
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/mcp-git
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/mcp-github
\```
